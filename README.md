# GuesTheNumber-Python
"Guess the Number" is an interactive Python game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game starts by generating a random number between a minimum and maximum value which can be chosen with 3 presets: Easy, Hard, Xtreme. The player is then prompted to enter their guess. If the guess is incorrect, the game provides feedback, informing the player if their guess was too high or too low. The player continues guessing until they correctly guess the number. Once the correct number is guessed, the game displays the number of attempts made and congratulates the player. The game offers an enjoyable challenge for players as they refine their guessing strategies and aim to guess the number in as few attempts as possible.
